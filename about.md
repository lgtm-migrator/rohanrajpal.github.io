- Made a [replica](https://github.com/rohanrajpal/APGame) of the popular Snake Vs Block using Java and JavaFX

Independent projects:

- I wrote a [recommender system for movies](https://github.com/rohanrajpal/movie-recommender-system). Implemented user-user and item-item collaborative filtering in Python. Used Flask, Javascript to build the web app and deployed it to Heroku.
- Made a [mini-ERP system](https://github.com/rohanrajpal/ERPSystem), an Android app in Java using Firebase for handling the data

- Working on analzing the social media data of an Indian app. Finding the possibility of an echo chamber within the app.
- Using NLP techniques like LDA to do Topic Modelling in text

### Community and Leadership

I like contributing to the community, here's what I'm trying to do from my side:

- Lead and founder, [Developer Students Club](http://dsc.iiitd.edu.in/) of IIITD.
- Mentor, [Student Mentorship Programme](https://www.iiitd.edu.in/mentorprogram/):  
  - Mentoring 7 freshmen and helping them with their academic, social and personal issues.
