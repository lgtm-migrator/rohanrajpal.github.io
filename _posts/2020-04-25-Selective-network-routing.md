Everyone is working from home and for me it is remotely working on the servers in my college. I can only connect to them via a VPN, but that slows down my browsing and video conferencing.  

I was trying to figure out a way to use VPN specifically for the server in college and let the other traffic move normally. That's when I came across [this solution][1]. In this blog I'll explain the solution step by step.  

tl,dr : **At the end of this blog you'll be able to select which website or IP addresses you want to route through the VPN.**

**Requirements:**

- Ubuntu (Should work on other Linux distros as well)
  - If you are using windows, this method works with Windows Subsystem for Linux. Do [ensure that you have WSL2][5] before proceeding.
- [Openfortivpn][6]
  - Ensure that you can connect to a VPN using it.

## Steps for selective routing

### 1. VPN configuration file

This file tells our VPN client the configuration of our VPN.

Save the below config file as vpn-config.conf anywhere on your computer

{% gist b443e20658cdf3e762a4e9df1a6e31bb vpn-config.conf %}

`set-routes = 0` specifies to not make any routes through the VPN, now we will whitelist the websites to use through the VPN.

### 2. Setup the PPP script

**What's PPP?**: PPP is Point to Point protocol. Linux uses this protocol to communicate over TCP/IP to your Internet Provider.[read more][3]

We are now going to write a script that will whitelist specific domains to pass through the VPN.

Use the following commands to create the script

```bash
sudo touch /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/fortivpn
sudo chmod a+x /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/fortivpn
```

**What's pppd?** The PPP Daemon (pppd) is a freely available implementation of the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) that runs on many Unix systems. [read more][4]

**What's ip-up?** /etc/ppp/ip-up is a shell script executed by pppd when the link/internet comes up. [read more][4]

Edit the above script with your favourite editor, it shall look like:

{% gist b443e20658cdf3e762a4e9df1a6e31bb my-pppscript.sh %}

Now add the ips and domains you want to access through the VPN. 

### 3. Run the VPN

The following command should connect you to your VPN now.

```bash
sudo openfortivpn -c vpn-config.conf
```

Below you can see the routes added for the ip addresses. ppp0 is the vpn interface and enp2s0 is the ethernet.

```bash
rohan@rohan-laptop ~> route                                                                  (base)
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
default         _gateway        0.0.0.0         UG    100    0        0 enp2s0
one.one.one.one 0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 ppp0
103.25.231.4    0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 ppp0
link-local      0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     1000   0        0 enp2s0
192.168.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     100    0        0 enp2s0
192.168.2.217   0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 ppp0
192.168.29.151  0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 ppp0
```

**That's about it!** You can now work on your server and enjoy fast internet along :)

### Bonus: Automatically start VPN on boot

It's quite irritating to log into the VPN everytime before starting work. So I created a system service to automatically connect to VPN on boot.
*Disclaimer:* this will not work with WSL2

Run these commands to setup the service

```bash
sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/openfortivpn.service
```

Open it with your favorite editor and enter this configuration. Thanks to [DimitriPapadopoulos](https://github.com/adrienverge/openfortivpn/issues/371#issuecomment-620720265) for helping me with it.

{% gist b443e20658cdf3e762a4e9df1a6e31bb openfortivpn.service %}

To start this service, simply run

```bash
sudo systemctl enable openfortivpn
sudo systemctl start openfortivpn
```

To check if it is running

```bash
rohan@rohan-laptop ~> sudo systemctl status openfortivpn
